Started out life in Westphalia still ravaged from the Napoleonic wars and when she reached early adulthood the tensions in the German alliance started to heighten as Prussia intended to unify Germany the bloody way. She was born to a family of grocers (Charlotte and Alvar), who fortunately were spared of the war's hardships. In her late teens she met [Klara Schmitt](Klara%20Kr채mer%20(formerly%20Schmitt).md), daughter of Smiths (Franziska and Knut; and her Sister Finja and Brother Sven), who she fell in love with and soon married. As tensions rose in their home the both of them decided to move to the United States in hopes of escaping the dangers at home and build a new life. As such the both of them decided to make a living as merchants travelling from the east coast all the way to the west coast. Over years they gain a reputation as quite reliable traders and get more and more peculiar goods.
 
When she was 23 the both of them received a very peculiar relic, unsure of its true capabilities, the both of them decided to hold on to it, hoping it would fetch a good price should they figure out what it really is. Though approximately one year later, this very relic would turn out to be their doom, as they were ambushed by a gang of robbers looking specifically for it. Even though the both of them surrendered, being clearly outnumbered, the captain of the robber band would execute [Klara](Klara%20Kr채mer%20(formerly%20Schmitt).md) and shoot Anna through the left eye, believing her to be dead. Anna clung on to life though as well as her wife's revolver and was rescued by a man named [Samuel Mullins](Samuel%20Mullins.md) from a nearby village. He helped patch her up and offered her a home to stay at.
 
She'd live there for approximately 6 years, trying to deal with the loss of her wife and find a way back into life. During this time she learned the craft of gunsmithing from [Samuel](Samuel%20Mullins.md), who she worked for as an apprentice. Until one day a familiar man arrived in the village, who referred to himself as [Zeke](Zeke.md). She recognized him to be the very man who shot both her wife and her and she tried to warn the rest of the village, but despite most of them having come to respect her, they didn't believe her, because the guy seemed very friendly. No one except [Samuel](Samuel%20Mullins.md) that is. He did believe her, but couldn't do anything on his own and decided to wait and see what would happen. For another 6 months everything seemed fine and even Anna started believing she must have misrecognized him. Until one night she awoke to the sounds of screams and terror as many of the villagers seem to have been turned into revenants and as she storms out of her bedroom she'd see as the man who took her wife from her now took [Samuel](Samuel%20Mullins.md) as well, as he used the very relic he took from them years ago to turn him into a revenant as well. He then tried to turn Anna as well, but with [Samuel's](Samuel%20Mullins.md) last remaining humanity he pushed the guy aside, giving Anna a chance to run. But her arm was already afflicted and it seemed to spread, so she had to use two hot horseshoes, a hammer and nails to make an improvised tourniquet, stopping the curse from spreading further. It did however still partially affect her face and her already damaged eye socket leaving a scar all the way to her eye. She barely escaped as the revenants kicked down the doors of the smithy and used a nearby mule to flee.

The last 3 and a half years now she has been training and preparing for the vengeance she will take on the man who took everything she had twice. During this time she befriended the mule she escaped with and came to name him Bock, referencing his first reluctance to listen to anything she'd tell him to do. She had now finally decided to join up with the blackwater gang in the hopes of finding allies for her vengeance as well as a means to locate the man she knows as [[Zeke]].


She used to be a cheerful person, though a bit reserved, and would always love to bring a smile to the people she dealt with. [Klara](Klara%20Kr채mer%20(formerly%20Schmitt).md) considered her to be like the sun, while she'd retreat every now and then, she'd bring light to all around her. She also used to be very polite and considerate of everyone. 

With [Klara's](Klara%20Kr채mer%20(formerly%20Schmitt).md) death however, she became much more reserved and her smile that used to lighten up everyone's mood had become much more rare. Thanks to [Sam's](Samuel%20Mullins.md) help however, she was able to deal with her loss a lot better than she could have without him and after a few years she could be seen smiling more often again.

The last of her smiles died with [Samuel](Samuel%20Mullins.md) and she has become very bitter, cynical and centered on her goals. The memory of her loved ones usually only causes pain, because she does not know how to deal with these losses.
