She grew up in the same Village as [Anna](Anna%20Krämer.md) as the daughter of blacksmiths. She used to often get into fights with many of the village's boys who didn't like her confident demeanor. As she got older she started helping out her parents with the sale of their goods and she quickly learned that she had a knack for selling things. This led her to often meet with [Anna](Anna%20Krämer.md) on the market and to them getting closer. They quickly realized they both felt a strong connection, much more than with anyone else. Klara often teased [Anna](Anna%20Krämer.md) a lot and [Anna](Anna%20Krämer.md) loved teasing her back. The both of them soon opened their own shop, though with the help of both of their parents they decided to move to the US, leaving behind the Kingdom of Westphalia. In the US, the both of them had to fend for themselves and Klara always stood up for the both of them, disregarding her own safety at times, which is why [Anna](Anna%20Krämer.md) soon got her a revolver so she could defend herself. It has Klara's name engraved on the right side of the barrel and [Anna's](Anna%20Krämer.md) on the left.

Soon the both of them would find an odd Relic that they'd keep their hands on to sell when they'd get the chance.

This would lead to unforeseen consequences for the both of them, resulting in Klara losing her life to outlaws and [Anna](Anna%20Krämer.md) losing her left eye, but more importantly: Klara.
