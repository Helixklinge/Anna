Samuel grew up in PLACEHOLDER NAME and growing up there he also met his future wife Grace, who was often traveling to PLACEHOLDER NAME, because of her job as a stagecoach driver. She took him along on her travels at one point and during these, he met several different skilled gunsmiths and studied under them, becoming a master gunsmith himself with time. At one point however, Grace became weaker and they decided to settle down in PLACEHOLDER NAME, so she could rest. Her illness never got better though, only worse and a few years later she succumbed to it, leaving Samuel devastated. He focused entirely on his work for a long time until he was called out for a patrol with the sheriff as they heard gunshots outside of town, only to then find Anna's body amongst the remains of a destroyed cart. They got her back to town and patched her back up and Samuel agreed to have her stay at his place. During his time with her, they bonded over their losses and both managed to heal to a degree. They both became very close, though no romantic relationship specifically ever developed, as both still felt somewhat bound to their deceased wives. Under Samuel's tutelage, Anna would learn how to become a gunsmith herself.
