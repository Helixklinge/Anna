Samuel grew up in Silvercreek and growing up there he also met his future wife Grace, who was often traveling to Silvercreek, because of her job as a stagecoach driver. She took him along on her travels at one point and during these, he met several different skilled gunsmiths and studied under them, becoming a master gunsmith himself with time. At one point however, Grace became weaker and they decided to settle down in Silvercreek, so she could rest. Her illness never got better though, only worse and a few years later she succumbed to it, leaving Samuel devastated.

Broken and lost without her, he poured his everything into his work, obsessively crafting weapons day and night. During this obsessive streak, he also started experimenting with new and odd weapon concepts, ridiculously massive, unwieldy and almost grotesque. Many of these never really saw the light of day, as he kept them hidden in his cellar. He kept working like a maniac for months, his good friend Paul trying to help him out of his precarious situation. 
One day he was called out for a patrol with the sheriff as they heard gunshots outside of town, only to then find Anna's body amongst the remains of a destroyed cart. They got her back to town and patched her back up and Samuel agreed to have her stay at his place, after Paul convinced him that it might do him some good.

During his time with her, they bonded over their losses and both managed to heal to a degree. They both became very close, though no romantic relationship specifically ever developed, as both still felt somewhat bound to their deceased wives. Under Samuel's tutelage, Anna would learn how to become a gunsmith herself. She was the only one to ever see some of his prototype weapons and while never even remotely mastering the work like he did, became a great assistant for his shop. 

During the night of the attack, he got turned by Zeke and with his last remaining consciousness stopped Zeke from fully turning Anna.
