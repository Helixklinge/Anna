A small town, built next to a small oasis formed by the creek. It's a small trade and supply post between other, more civilized towns and cities. 

It's got an apothecary, a small shop, a saloon, a gunsmith and cattle farms. 

It has been overrun by an unknown force of revenants or something similar, that have since made it a dangerous spot for all travelers to avoid.
