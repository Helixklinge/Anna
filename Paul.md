Paul is a former military medic, turned apothecary in Silvercreek. Having retired from fighting he just seeks the quiet life in Silvercreek. Had a few relationships that never really went well, so he decided to just leave it for a few decades. Good friend of Samuel, though generally rather reserved. Did regularly drink Sam under the table. Paul and Sam used to go fishing together as a pastime. Once the patrol, who he was a part of, found Anna and brought her back to town, Paul was responsible for bringer her back from the brink properly and making sure she recovered as well as possible. He also encouraged Sam and Anna to form a bond. 

During the night of the attack, he was lured into a trap to be taken out, as he did have significant military experience. Anna saw his revenant form while fleeing on Bock.
